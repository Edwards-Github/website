# HTML & CSS Practice

## Project Overview
This repository contains a web development project created to explore the fundamentals of HTML and CSS. Inspired by tutorials from Bro Code, this project serves as a hands-on way to practice building structured and visually appealing web pages. While the project is still evolving, I’m sharing it to document my learning journey and potentially inspire others diving into web development.

## Purpose and Progress
The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of web development by applying concepts from HTML and CSS. By following Bro Code’s tutorials, I’ve built the foundation of this project and am actively working on refining it. Though it’s a work in progress, sharing it here allows me to track my growth and receive feedback from the community.

## Acknowledgments
A big thank-you to Bro Code for the insightful tutorials that guided me through this project. Learning from others’ expertise has been invaluable, and I hope this repository can motivate others to start their own web development journey.
